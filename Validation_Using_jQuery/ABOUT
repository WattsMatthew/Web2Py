Developed with web2py.

Application: Done Customize validation using jQuery.
Description:
	    In general we use requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY() for validation in web2py.
but what if I want to do customize validation on specific fields. We can do it using jQuery. You've to figure out following files:

Database-/models/db.py
#This file contains table Creation details.

Controllers-/controllers/default.py
#This file contains grid creation other details
#see function taxer()

Validation-/views/default/taxer.html
#at end of this file, It contains jQuery code for validation

Cheers
